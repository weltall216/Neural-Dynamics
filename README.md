Vector Field Topology of Time-Dependent Flows in a Steady Reference Frame

The State of the Art in Vortex Extraction

### Steady Vector field

vector field : critical point, Jacobian of vector field, existence & extraction, 

topological element (2d, 3d) : source, repelling saddle, attracting saddle, sink, closed curve, boundary switch point, attatchment and detachment points, isolated closed streamlines, separatrices, saddle connectors and boundary switch connectors, vortex corelines, bifurcation lines

Invariant Manifold (N-dim) : particle invariant set - every critical point, every closed orbit and every separatrix + every trajectory

Feature Curves : Bifurcation lines, Vortex corelines
